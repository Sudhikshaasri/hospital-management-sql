#Hospital Management Database System (SQL)

This project is a relational database system designed to manage hospital operations involving doctors, nurses, patients, and appointments.

The database follows normalization principles to avoid redundancy and uses primary and foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity. A junction table (appointments) is used to model the many-to-many relationship between doctors and patients.

Key Features:
Normalized relational schema
Primary & foreign key constraints
One-to-many and many-to-many relationships
JOIN queries
Aggregate functions with GROUP BY & HAVING
Subqueries, views, and indexing
LIMIT & OFFSET for pagination
Demonstrates DELETE vs TRUNCATE behavior

Technologies Used:
MySQL / SQL

Use Case:
This project simulates real-world hospital data management and is intended for academic learning, SQL practice, and database design demonstration.
